                Text("Analog phones are prone to interference and their signals can be picked up by anyone using a radio scanner set to the same frequency, which isn't ideal for private conversations (e.g., when giving out your credit card number to a bank).")
                Text("Voice scramble analog phones scramble the audio before it's transmitted between the base and handset, and is then unscrambled when it's sent to the receiving end. For example, when you say \"Hello\" into the handset, it becomes \"Grblm\" before it is sent to the base, where it then becomes \"Hello\" again before it's sent to the caller. This way, anyone using a radio scanner to pick up the signal will hear the scrambled audio, which they won't be able to understand, while you and the caller hear it as if there wasn't any scrambling at all.")
                Text("Digital Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) phones spread the signal accross multiple channels. Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) phones constantly switch between several different wireless channels. Using one of these technologies, if someone were to pick up the signal with a digital radio scanner, they would only hear a very tiny bit of the audio.")
                Text("\"Frequency 1/Frequency 2\" (e.g., 5.8GHz/900MHz) means that the base transmits to the handset using frequency 1 and the handset transmits to the base using frequency 2. As a result, the phone may lose connection on the transmit side before losing connection on the receiving side, or vice versa, but the handset will be considered \"out of range\" when either side drops out.")
                Text("\"Frequency 1-Frequency 2\" (e.g., 1.92GHz-1.93GHz) means that the phone operates in a range of frequencies, not just one specific frequency.")
                Text("DECT uses encryption, making it the most secure cordless phone frequency. And since it's dedicated to cordless phones, baby monitors, and related devices, other wireless devices won't interfere with the phone.")
