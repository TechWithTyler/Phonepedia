        InfoText("Phones with multiple ringtone choices often have a combination of standard and music/melody ringtones. Standard ringtones include one or more variations of a standard phone ring, and may also include other choices of sounds. Music/melody ringtones add more variety to a phone's ringtone options, but don't follow the ring signal, so the music/melody ringtone may continue to play for a bit after another phone on the same line is answered or the caller hangs up.\nMulti-line phones without selectable ringtones have a different ringtone for each line, so you can identify which line is ringing based on the ringtone. For example, line 2 might have a different-pitched version of line 1's ringtone.")
