        InfoText("Phones with multiple ringtone choices often have a combination of standard and music/melody ringtones. Standard ringtones include one or more variations of a standard phone ring, and may also include other choices of sounds. Music/melody ringtones add more variety to a phone's ringtone options, but don't follow the ring signal, so the music/melody ringtone may continue to play for a bit after another phone on the same line is answered or the caller hangs up.")
