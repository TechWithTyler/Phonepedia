When hanging up an analog phone, communication between the handset and base is abruptly terminated, which causes the other end to hear a short burst of noise. On some phones, placing the handset on the base will cause the phone to hang up immediately, in which case this burst of noise won't be heard. Another way you can tell you're using an analog phone is if you or the other end hear static when going out of range, vs the audio clipping in and out on a digital cordless phone.")
                    Text("Voice scramble analog phones scramble the audio before it's transmitted between the base and handset, and is then unscrambled when it's sent to the receiving end. For example, when you say \"Hello\" into the handset, it becomes \"Grblm\" (gibberish used as example of scrambled speech) before it's sent to the base, where it then becomes \"Hello\" again before it's sent to the caller. This way, anyone using a radio scanner to pick up the signal will hear the scrambled audio, which they likely won't be able to understand, while you and the caller hear it as if there wasn't any scrambling at all.")

The person on the other end won't hear a short burst of noise when hanging up like on an analog phone. Some digital cordless phones operate on only one channel at a time, so they're still prone to interference and their signals can be picked up by a digital radio scanner.")
                    Text("Digital Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) phones spread the signal across multiple channels. This is  most commonly referred to as simply Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS). Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) phones constantly switch between several different channels. Using one of these technologies, if someone were to pick up the signal with a digital radio scanner, they would only hear a very tiny bit of the audio.")

As a result, the phone may lose connection on the transmit side before losing connection on the receiving side, or vice versa, but the handset will be considered \"out of range\" when either side drops out.")

Regular DECT, used elsewhere, uses frequencies ranging from 1.88GHz (1880MHz) to 1.92GHz (1920MHz).")
