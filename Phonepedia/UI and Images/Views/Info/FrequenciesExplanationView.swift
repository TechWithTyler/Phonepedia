                    Text("Analog phones transmit and receive analog audio signals. These phones are prone to interference and their signals can be picked up by anyone using a radio scanner set to the same frequency, which isn't ideal for private conversations (e.g., when giving out your credit card number to a bank or entering the password for your voicemail). When hanging up an analog phone, when dialing numbers, or pressing other buttons that send a command to the base, communication between the handset and base is briefly interrupted, which causes the other end to hear a short burst of noise. On some phones, placing the handset on the base will cause the phone to hang up immediately by terminating the handset and base connections at the same time, in which case this burst of noise won't be heard. Another way you can tell you're using an analog phone is if you or the other end hear static when going out of range, vs the audio clipping in and out on a digital cordless phone.")
                    Text("Some 46-49MHz and 900MHz analog phones include a technology known as voice scrambling, which scrambles the audio before it's transmitted between the base and handset, and is then unscrambled when it's sent to the receiving end. For example, when you say \"Hello\" into the handset, it becomes \"Grblm\" (gibberish used as example of scrambled speech) before it's sent to the base, where it then becomes \"Hello\" again before it's sent to the caller. This way, anyone using a radio scanner to pick up the signal will hear the scrambled audio, which they likely won't be able to understand, while you and the caller hear it as if there wasn't any scrambling at all.")
                    Text("There are many voice scrambling methods. Frequency inversion scrambling, the most common and least complex, flips the audio spectrum, so low frequencies become high frequencies, and vice versa. Split-band scrambling divides and inverts parts of the audio spectrum. Time-division scrambling chops the signal into segments and rearranges them. Rolling code scrambling uses dynamic codes to continuously alter the signal. Noise injection adds artificial noise to obscure the voice.")

The person on the other end won't hear a short burst of noise when hanging up or pressing buttons like on an analog phone. Some digital cordless phones operate on only one channel at a time, so they're still prone to interference and their signals can be picked up by a digital radio scanner, which may reveal information about the communication or decode the audio data.")
                    Text("Digital Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) phones spread the signal across multiple channels. This is  most commonly referred to as simply Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS). Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) phones constantly switch between several different channels. Using one of these technologies, if someone were to pick up the signal with a digital radio scanner, they would only hear a very tiny bit of the audio if it's decoded.")

As a result, the phone may lose connection on the transmit side before losing connection on the receiving side, or vice versa, but the handset will be considered \"out of range\" when either side drops out.")
                    Text("\"Frequency 1-Frequency 2\" (e.g., 1.92GHz-1.93GHz) means that the phone operates in a range of frequencies, not just one specific frequency. The frequencies are within a few MHz (often 10-20MHz) of each other.")

Regular DECT, used elsewhere, uses frequencies ranging from 1.88GHz (1880MHz) to 1.92GHz (1920MHz).")
