Silent mode can be set on a daily schedule or manually set to last for a certain number of hours, depending on the phone.\nOn some phones, the key tone/confirmation tone/error tone and/or answering system call screening will also be muted, and the answering system will turn on.\nOn some cordless phones, silent mode is a system-wide setting, so turning it on for the base or one handset will turn it on for all handsets/the base.")
