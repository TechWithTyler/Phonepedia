The use of all-caps is to avoid having names like \"McDonald\" appear with only the first letter capitalized, and to make it readable on caller ID displays that don't support or properly display lowercase letters (e.g. a low-end cordless phone with a segmented monochrome display). Displaying the name in \"First Last\" format is often one of the reasons people will store names and numbers in the phonebook, even if they don't often use the phonebook for dialing.")

Having 2 or more spaces between the name and location is due to CNAM being a fixed-width field. CNAM is limited to 15 characters, so in some cases, the name may be truncated in unexpected ways.")

The originating provider digitally signs the caller ID information, and the destination provider digitally verifies the signature. If a call is verified, the CNAM or number-as-name caller ID is prepended with \"[V]\". If the call is not verified, it's prepended with \"Spam?\". The prepended text uses up part of the caller ID name, so not all names that once fit pre-STIR/SHAKEN will fit, especially on phones/caller ID equipment which assume a 15-character limit. Also note that at the time of the release of this version of \(appName!), STIR/SHAKEN is only used if both ends of the call are VoIP.")
