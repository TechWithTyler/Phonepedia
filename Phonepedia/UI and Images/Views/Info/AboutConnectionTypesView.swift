Analog or digital phone jacks on a PBX directly correspond to an internal phone line called an extension. Ethernet jacks on a VoIP PBX are only used to connect phones/devices to the network--the device itself needs to be configured to use the desired extension. Each extension is assigned an internal number called an extension number, which can only be dialed from phones/devices on the same PBX. To access the outside line, a leading digit (e.g. 9) must be dialed to connect the given extension to an outside line (this is why hotel phones say something like \"dial 9 + area code + number\") on their faceplates. There can only be as many extensions on separate outside calls as there are outside lines. The outside line is optional on many PBXs, so if you just want internal lines, a PBX is a great option.")

With mechanical ringers, the \"on\" causes the striker to hit the bell, and the \"off\" causes the striker to reset. In a phone with a dual-bell ringer, the striker is always against a bell. With electronic ringers, the \"on\" causes the ringer to make a sound, and the \"off\" causes the sound to stop. The actual tone/pattern of the ringer is determined by the programming of the ringer. For example, most piezo ringers play a tone consisting of 2 alternate frequencies for as long as the ring signal is applied. The fade-out or slight continuation of the sound when the ring stops is due to the delay circuitry/programming in the ringer, which prevents the tone from restarting from the beginning with every \"on\".")

In many countries, caller ID FSK tones are sent after the first ring, which is why caller ID usually won't display on an analog phone right as it starts ringing or if you connect it to the line after the first ring. If caller ID FSK tones were to be sent after each ring, the phone may end up logging the caller ID data as a missed call each time.")

DTMF caller ID is sent as a series of DTMF tones, which are the same tones used for dialing numbers on a touch-tone phone. The first and last DTMF tones are different from the tones that make up the digits of the number, and are used to tell the phone when the caller ID data starts and ends. The start tone (e.g. D) tells the phone to listen for the tones that follow, and the end tone (e.g. C) tells the phone that caller ID transmission is done and the number can now be presented as caller ID (i.e., displayed, logged in the caller ID list, and/or announced depending on the phone). For example, if the DTMF tone D is transmitted to indicate the beginning of the caller ID data, the DTMF tone C is transmitted to indicate the end of the caller ID data, and the caller ID number is the UK domestic number \(exampleDTMFCallerIDNumber), the DTMF tones that make up the caller ID data would be D\(exampleDTMFCallerIDNumber)C. As there are only 16 possible DTMF digits (0-9, star, pound, and A-D), DTMF caller ID can't transmit names. DTMF caller ID is slower to be displayed on a phone than FSK caller ID, as it takes longer to transmit each tone of a long DTMF caller ID string than a short FSK tone, just like how the tones that make up dial-up internet take longer to be sent/received than the quick pulses of light over fiber internet.")
