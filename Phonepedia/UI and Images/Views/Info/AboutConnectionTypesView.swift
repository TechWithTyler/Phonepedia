To access the outside line, a leading digit (e.g. 9) must be dialed to connect the given extension to an outside line (this is why hotel phones say something like \"dial 9 + area code + number\") on their faceplates.

In many countries, caller ID FSK tones are sent after the first ring (if you're listening in on the phone line, the ring signal sounds like buzzing/a bunch of rapid clicks), which is why caller ID usually won't display on an analog phone right as it starts ringing or if you connect it to the line after the first ring. If caller ID FSK tones were to be sent after each ring, the phone may end up logging the caller ID data as a missed call each time.")
