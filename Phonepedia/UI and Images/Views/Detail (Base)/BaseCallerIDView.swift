            InfoText("If the incoming caller ID phone number matches an entry in the phonebook, the entry name is displayed instead of the caller ID name sent by the phone service provider. For example, if the incoming caller ID name is \"\(cnamForName(exampleName))\" and the number is 555-555-1234, and you store that number to the phonebook with name \"\(exampleName)\", the incoming caller ID will show as \"\(exampleName)\" instead of \"\(cnamForName(exampleName))\".\nA caller's name shown in caller ID is called CNAM, and is displayed in \"LAST, FIRST\" format so the recipient's phone service provider's systems can sort through the database of names and find the name corresponding to the number. The use of all-caps is to avoid having names like \"McDonald\" appear with only the first letter capitalized, and to make it readable on caller ID displays that don't support or properly display lowercase letters (e.g. a low-end cordless phone with a segmented monochrome display). Displaying the name in \"First Last\" format is often one of the reasons people will store names and numbers in the phonebook, even if they don't often use the phonebook for dialing.\nIf a name isn't available for a caller, or if you don't have CNAM caller ID with your phone service provider, the number will be displayed as the name in the format 5555551234 instead of 555-555-1234 or (555) 555-1234, for compatibility with displays that don't support punctuation.")
