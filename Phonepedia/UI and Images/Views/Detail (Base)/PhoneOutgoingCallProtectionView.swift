Depending on the phone, this means only the emergency number (e.g., 911 in the US or 999/112 in the UK) can be dialed, or numbers you want to designate as emergency numbers can be saved to the phonebook.\nOn some cordless phones, the list of disallowed numbers can be applied to specific handsets.")
