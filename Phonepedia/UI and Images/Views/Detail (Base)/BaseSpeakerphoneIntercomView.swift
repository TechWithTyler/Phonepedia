When you hang your handset/base up or the other person accepts the call (this depends on the phone), the other person is connected to the call.\nSome phones have the option to transfer calls directly. When using the transfer option, or if using the intercom option and hanging up before the other person (this depends on the phone), the call rings at the base/cordless device the call was transferred to.
