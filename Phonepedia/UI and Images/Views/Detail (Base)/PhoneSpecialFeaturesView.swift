        InfoText("\"Not in service\" tones, also known as Special Information Tones or SIT tones, are the 3 rising tones you often hear when you call a number that's out of service or that can't be dialed. Some autodialers will remove any numbers that play SIT tones from their lists so they won't call them again. Because of this, some phones/devices were designed to play SIT tones when a phone on the line was answered, making autodialers remove your number from their list. However, most autodialers today no longer use SIT tone detection as they have other means of knowing what numbers are or aren't in service, and today's phones don't include this feature for many reasons including confused callers and desired automated calls having working numbers removed from their lists. SIT tones may also play when calling working numbers if the call can't be completed for another reason, which can also cause autodialers to remove working numbers from their lists. You may still hear these tones if you call an out-of-service number or when calls can't be completed, depending on the provider that serves the area or that formerly served the number, or depending on how your provider handles out-of-service numbers/when calls can't be completed.")
