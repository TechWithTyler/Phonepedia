You can access the phone's features even when it isn't connected to a line.\nMost line-powered or battery-powered corded phones will keep their memory intact for some time if line/battery power is lost (usually 72 hours).\nMost AC-powered corded phones can work on line power when the power is out. If the phone takes AC power and backup batteries, usually only the batteries will provide backup power--the phone won't work at all once the batteries run out.")
