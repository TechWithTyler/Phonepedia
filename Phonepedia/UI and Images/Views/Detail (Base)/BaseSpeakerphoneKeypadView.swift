Bases with keypads are a great option for office spaces as they combine a cordless-only phone with the design people expect from an office phone.\nSome corded phones, such as those found in hotel lobbies, don't have a user-accessible keypad and are used only for answering calls, checking voicemail, or calling a specific number when picking it up. The keypad and other programming controls are hidden behind a removable faceplate or within the phone's casing.")
