Speed dial is usually used by holding down the desired number key or by pressing a button (usually called "Auto", "Mem", or "Memory") followed by the desired number key.
One-touch/memory dial is when the phone has dedicated speed dial buttons which either start dialing immediately when pressed, or which display/announce the stored number which can be dialed by then going off-hook. Some phones tie the one-touch/memory dial buttons to the first few speed dial locations (e.g. a phone with 10 speed dials (1-9 and 0) and memory dial A-C might use memory dial A-C as a quicker way to dial the number in speed dial 1-3.
The speed dial entry mode describes how phonebook entries are saved to speed dial locations and whether they allow numbers to be manually entered. "Copy" means the phonebook entry will be copied to the speed dial location, and editing the phonebook entry won't affect the speed dial entry. "Link" means the speed dial entry is tied to the corresponding phonebook entry, so editing the phonebook entry will affect the speed dial entry and vice versa, and the speed dial entry will be deleted if the corresponding phonebook entry is deleted.
By assigning a handset number to a cordless or corded/cordless phone base's one-touch dial button, you can press it to quickly intercom/transfer a call to that handset.
